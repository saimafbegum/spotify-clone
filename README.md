# Spotify-Clone

As a part of learning web development, I created a static clone of the Spotify web interface using HTML and CSS only. This project is designed to showcase my front-end layout and styling skills. The website is responsive and mimics the UI of Spotify.

There is no JavaScript used in this project - it focuses purely in the structure and design.
